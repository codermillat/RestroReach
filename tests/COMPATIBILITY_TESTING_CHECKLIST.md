## Quick Testing Commands

### WooCommerce Integration Test
```bash
# Check WooCommerce version compatibility
wp plugin list | grep woocommerce

# Test custom order statuses
wp eval "print_r(wc_get_order_statuses());"

# Create test order
wp eval "
\$order = new WC_Order();
\$order->set_billing_email('test@example.com');
\$order_id = \$order->save();
echo 'Order created: ' . \$order_id;
"
```

### Database Performance Test
```bash
# Test database connection
wp db check

# Test query performance
wp eval "
global \$wpdb;
\$start = microtime(true);
\$orders = \$wpdb->get_results('SELECT * FROM wp_posts WHERE post_type=\"shop_order\" LIMIT 100');
\$time = microtime(true) - \$start;
echo 'Query time: ' . round(\$time * 1000, 2) . 'ms';
"
```

### Google Maps API Test
```bash
# Test API key configuration
wp option get rdm_google_maps_api_key

# Test geocoding (requires API key)
curl "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=1600+Amphitheatre+Parkway&key=YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Plugin Lifecycle Test
```bash
# Test activation
wp plugin activate restaurant-delivery-manager

# Check tables created
wp db query "SHOW TABLES LIKE 'wp_rr_%'"

# Test deactivation
wp plugin deactivate restaurant-delivery-manager

# Test reactivation
wp plugin activate restaurant-delivery-manager
```

## Automated Testing Scripts

### Run Compatibility Tests
```bash
# Execute comprehensive compatibility tests
php tests/compatibility-tests.php

# Run in WordPress context
wp eval-file tests/compatibility-tests.php
```

### Performance Stress Test
```bash
# Run database stress tests
php tests/stress-test-database.php

# Run API stress tests  
node tests/google-maps-stress-test.js
```

## Test Environment Setup

### Staging Environment Requirements
- WordPress 6.0+
- WooCommerce 8.0+
- PHP 8.0+
- MySQL 8.0+ / MariaDB 10.5+
- Test domain with SSL
- Google Maps API test key

### Test Data Setup
```bash
# Create test agents
wp eval "
global \$wpdb;
\$wpdb->insert(
    \$wpdb->prefix . 'rr_delivery_agents',
    array(
        'user_id' => 1,
        'name' => 'Test Agent',
        'phone' => '555-123-4567',
        'vehicle_type' => 'bike',
        'is_available' => 1
    )
);
"

# Create test orders
for i in {1..10}; do
  wp eval "
  \$order = new WC_Order();
  \$order->set_billing_email('test$i@example.com');
  \$order->set_status('processing');
  \$order->save();
  "
done
```

## Pass/Fail Criteria

### Critical Tests (Must Pass)
