## üìä CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

### For Cursor AI Chat Context (Cmd+L / Ctrl+L):

**1. Daily Development Context:**
```markdown
Working on Restaurant Delivery Management System
- Current Phase: [Phase from DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md]
- Today's Goal: [Specific feature from timeline]
- Last Completed: [Recent achievement]
- Next Priority: [Immediate next task]
- Context Files: PROJECT_CONTEXT.md, .cursorrules, FEATURE_SPECIFICATIONS.md
```

**2. Feature-Specific Context:**
```markdown
Building [Specific Feature Name]
- Requirements: See FEATURE_SPECIFICATIONS.md section [X]
- Implementation: Follow .cursorrules guidelines
- Database: Use API_REFERENCE.md functions
- Progress: Update DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md when complete
```

**3. Debugging Context:**
```markdown

## üéØ CURSOR AI SETUP WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Verify Essential Files
```bash
# Check that all essential files exist
ls -la *.md .cursorrules
# Should show:
# .cursorrules
# PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
# DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md
# FEATURE_SPECIFICATIONS.md
# API_REFERENCE.md
```

### Step 2: Set Initial Context
Open Cursor AI (Cmd+L) and paste:
```
I'm working on a Restaurant Delivery Management System plugin for WordPress/WooCommerce. Please review these context files:

1. .cursorrules - Development guidelines
2. PROJECT_CONTEXT.md - Complete project overview  
3. DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md - Current progress
4. FEATURE_SPECIFICATIONS.md - Detailed requirements
5. API_REFERENCE.md - Function library

Current status: [Get from DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md]
Next task: [Get from DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md]

Ready to start development following the .cursorrules guidelines.
```

### Step 3: Daily Context Refresh
Each day, update Cursor AI with:
```
Development Status Update:
- Yesterday completed: [List achievements]
- Today's focus: [Current priority from DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md]
- Blockers: [Any issues from DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md]
- Please follow .cursorrules for all code generation
```

## üìà CURSOR AI PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

### **Context File Priority (Most Important First):**

1. **`.cursorrules`** - AI understands HOW to code
2. **`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`** - AI understands WHAT to build
3. **`DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md`** - AI understands WHERE we are
4. **`FEATURE_SPECIFICATIONS.md`** - AI understands EXACT requirements
5. **`API_REFERENCE.md`** - AI understands IMPLEMENTATION details

### **File Size Optimization:**
- Keep each file under 10KB for best AI parsing
- Use clear headings and bullet points
- Include code examples in every technical section
- Update DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md after each session

### **Context Chaining Strategy:**
When working on complex features:
1. Reference main context files first
2. Focus on specific feature specification
3. Use API reference for implementation
4. Update development status after completion
